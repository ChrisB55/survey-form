# Responsive Survey Form Project.


#### This is a survery form built to the requirements of the "Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form" assignment by Free Code Camp.(https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/)


#### I build the form using Sass, but didn't use bootstrap or any other css framework. The form was built from a mobile-first design approach and uses four breakpoints as the screen size becomes larger. -CWB
